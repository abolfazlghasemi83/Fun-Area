# 🤖 AI Showdown: The Animation Challenge

Welcome to the AI Showdown! In this project, four leading AI models were put to the test with a single creative coding prompt. The goal was to see how each one interprets the task and generates a functional web animation from scratch.

## 🎯 The Challenge Prompt

The following prompt was given to all contenders without any modifications:

> "Create an HTML animation where a ball starts in the center of a triangle. Each time it collides with one of the triangle's sides, it gains speed and adds one side to the shape."

## 🥊 The Contenders

The four AI models that participated in this challenge were:

*   **ChatGPT** (by OpenAI)
*   **Gemini** (by Google)
*   **Qwen** (by Alibaba Cloud)
*   **KimiAi**

The source code generated by each AI is located in the `Source-code` sub-folder, completely unedited, allowing for a direct and fair comparison of their capabilities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This showcase is built entirely with fundamental web technologies:

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **JavaScript**
